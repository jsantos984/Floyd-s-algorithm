# Floyd´s Algorithm

## Floyd´s project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement the Floyd´s algorithm, using Python. Floyd´s algorithm is used to search the shortest way between  all nodes in a graph

## Setup Instructions for Floyd´s Algorithm

If you need to run this Floyd´s algorithm, please follow this steps:

1. Clone the git repo to your local machine.
      git clone  https://github.com/jsantos984/University-of-Liverpool-Floyd-s-algorithm 
2. Move to the right folder
   cd https://github.com/jsantos984/University-of-Liverpool-Floyd-s-algorithm
3. Run the code: execute the Python Floyd´s Algorithm
    python floyd.py
4. View the results - shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph, after the algorithm finish running.

## Running the tests

In order to guarantee the corrct implementation, follow the next steps.
1. run the tests, by executing the script that contain the unit tests and the performance test.
        python test.py
2. See the results. After running the tests , see the output to guarantee all tests passed successfully.
